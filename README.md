# Android-Airline-Reservation-System

The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is an android application (called Flight) that makes the flight booking process for airline travellers as easy and efficient as possible as it contains fare comparison capabilties, multiple airline schedules and other time and money saving features.


## Note: 
This was a class project for my winter 2022 term and the project was done in group of 5 members. *Contributions where made on class repo in gitlab*

Followed these [coding standards](CodingStandards.md) to ensure clean code.

As a team we followed these [contribution guidelines](Contributing.md).

We used the 3-tier architecture by splitting the work into presentation layer, logic layer and persistence layer.

This app mimics the airline reservation system.

To run: simply clone the repo and open it in android studio (refer to this [Acceptance File](AcceptanceTest.md) to see how to simulate the app).
