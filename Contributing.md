# Branching Strategy
Team chose to implement the master branch and development branch as the two main branches with tasks branches which will include the tasks assigned.

## Branches Details
**Master:** Will be the production environment and will contain the final release of the application.
**Development:** Will be the sandbox environment and will contain the working version of the application as its being developed. *Team members will clone this branch* onto there local enviroment and creeate task related branches.
**Task branches:** Will be created by each individual when working on a certain task and is based off cloned development branch.
*No need to delete your created task branch when merging to development*

### Task Branches Naming Guideline
Task assigned branches will be named according to the issue your working on and will be named as follows: written in **small letter** with camel case.
```
selectTravelDates
```
## Commit Messages Guideline
Every completion of a task assigned branch must be followed with a commit message with the following guidelines.
* Commit message must be *short* and *summarize what you did*.
* *First letter* of the commit message must begin with a *capital letter*
Examples are shown below
```
Added the select travel date functionality 
```

## Merging Possibilities 
**Task branch merging to Development:** This merge will occur *throughout the iteration* working period. When your assigned task is completed you can merge it to development with the new added functionality and close the assigned issue.
**Development to Master:** This merger will occur to release the application. It will only occur when the *iteration* is completed. Since project has 3 iterations, there will be roughly 3 merge requests relating to development to master merging.

### Merge Requests Guideline
**Title:** Should summarizes the changes made. 
**Body:** To be filled *only* if the title does not describe the changes 
**Extra Details:** Should include a *closes issue #* if this is clossing the assigned task 


## Closing Issues
**Time Spent:** Must add the time spend on the task before closing the issue. 
Add sample code below to the issue being worked on to be able to enter the time spend on code.
```
/spend 1d //meaning you spent a  day to do the task 
/spend 4h 
or use 1mo 2w 3d 4h 5m 2018-08-26 or
```

## Meetings Guidelines
**Medium used:** Meetings are to be held online over Zoom or cisco webex during class times. 
**Whats to be communicated:** Team members are to communicate the status of there assigned tasks to the team.
